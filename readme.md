# LightNet

lightnet is a simple implementation of convolution neural network for myself to understand the basic ideas about how to build a neural network, especially about back propagation algorithm and optimization.

### Features

* The core of this project is less than 1000 lines, all in one header file.

* Only use c++ standard library as dependency.
* OOP style and easy to read. 
* API copies PyTorch a lot, so you may feel familiar : )
* Simple examples for classification and regression, also has MNIST classification.
