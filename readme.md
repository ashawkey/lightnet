# lightnet

lightnet is a simple implementation of convolutional neural network for myself to understand the basic ideas about how to build a neural network, especially about back propagation algorithm and optimization.

### Features

* The core of this project is less than 1000 lines, all in one header file.
* Only use c++ standard library as dependency.
* OOP style and easy to read. 
* API copies PyTorch a lot, so you may feel familiar : )
* Simple examples for classification and regression, also has MNIST classification.

### Reference
* [simple_cnn](https://github.com/can1357/simple_cnn)
    Idea and codes for MNIST dataset preparation.
